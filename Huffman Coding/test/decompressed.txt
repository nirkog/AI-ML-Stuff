FADE IN:
INT. RAVIGA CAPITAL - LAURIE'S OFFICE - DAY
LAURIE
Have a seat.
There aren't any. RICHARD sits Indian-style on the floor
and peers up clumsily over the desk.
LAURIE
At Raviga Capital, we pride
ourselves on being "founder
friendly."
RICHARD
You fired me on Snapchat.
LAURIE (CONT'D)
That respect is critical to our
deal flow. We know entrepreneurs
have plenty of suitors on Sand
Hill.
RICHARD
You didn't even write anything.
Richard holds up his phone. Her snap is just ! -- the fire
emoji -- huge.
LAURIE
It's disrespectful to screenshot
snaps.
RICHARD
It was hard with your one second
timer.
LAURIE
I'm setting up interviews for your
replacement and we'd like you to
participate. This is a small town;
the board wants everyone to know
you're on board with the board.
RICHARD
There's no way I'm gonna help you
hire someone else.
LAURIE
Well if you don't, Pied Piper
might experience a little
"compression" of its own.
3.
RICHARD
What?
LAURIE
(chuckling)
Just a little wordplay. No, it
means we'll fire you.
Richard holds up his phone ("you already did that").
LAURIE
We're "managing you out" of the
CEO role, not Pied Piper itself.
No one knows more about the tech
than you do.
RICHARD
So...you're looking for a CEO with
a little less experience?
LAURIE
We're looking for a CEO, period.
RICHARD
(flustered)
I'm already...this company was...
LAURIE
And there's the problem, isn't it.
A leader campaigns in poetry and
governs in prose. You sound like
Siri having a stroke.
RICHARD
I wrote almost every line of code
in Pied Piper. Every function,
every class, every library.
LAURIE
And you're a gifted coder, no
question. But a leader has
command. A leader has presence.
You're smart beyond compare,
Richard. But you are not a CEO.
Laurie walks out.
RICHARD
(convincing himself)
I have presence.
A beat. And then the automatic office lights turn off,
unaware our hapless hero is still down on the floor. The
pitch blackness gives way to...

OPENING CREDITS
INT. HACKER HOUSE - DAY
DINESH
Isn't it weird how fun it sounds
to get laid off? Like, everyone
wants to get laid. And everyone
wants to get off. But nobody wants
to get laid off.
GILFOYLE
I wouldn't mind your mom's pink
slip.
DINESH
Well, your ex did put you on a
performance improvement plan.
ERLICH
This is so fucked. His name's on
the door and they shat all over
him anyway, just to hire some
suit. It's like firing Captain
Crunch.
(roleplaying)
Hey kids, sorry I didn't have time
to get my MBA while I was
pioneering the entire field of
maritime breakfast. You'll just
have to bend over for Admiral
Wharton's plank instead.
GILFOYLE
Are you saying that Captain Crunch
was on a career path to
pedophilia?
ERLICH
I'm saying he deserved a chance to
find out.
DINESH
I don't even understand how this
is possible. Richard is the firer,
not the firee. He's the boss.
JARED
Actually, it's a common
misconception that the CEO is the
final authority. She serves at the
pleasure of the shareholders. 
5.
GILFOYLE
She?
JARED
(beaming)
I'm PC.
GILFOYLE
Name one female CEO who isn't...
JARED
Marissa--
GILFOYLE
...Marissa Mayer.
DINESH
YouTube's chief is a woman.
GILFOYLE
You mean the one who reports to
Larry Page.
DINESH
No, her boss is Google's CEO. And
then his boss is Alphabet's CEO,
Larry.
GILFOYLE
So she's a CEO...who reports to a
man...who reports to a man.
Satanists believe every living
being is a God and we still have
less red tape than that shit. I
guess you feel right at home
though; Indians have 57 chiefs for
sand.
DINESH
I'm Pakistani.
JARED
This actually illustrates my
point: Richard doesn't have as
much power as you might think.
Look -- here's how you probably
imagine the org chart.
Jared whiteboards a typical org chart "tree": Richard on
top, then Jared, and finally Dinesh.
GILFOYLE
We don't report to you.
6.
JARED
Well, that's murky.
GILFOYLE
To the person explaining it?
JARED
...But this is how the world
really looks.
Jared draws a new org chart: investors on top, then the
board, and finally Richard.
JARED
The investors pick the board, the
board picks the CEO. So really,
Richard is merely Dinesh when you
look at the big picture. Isn't
that funny?
DINESH
I don't see you up there either.
JARED
(defensive)
Well, that's different, because...
GILFOYLE
Oh he's up there.
Gilfoyle walks up to the board and draws a tiny nub
emanating straight from the zip code of Richard's family
jewels. He labels it "OJ".
GILFOYLE
There he is. Richard's "richard."
DINESH
Richard the Second.
GILFOYLE
I like that.
JARED
I don't know that more pseudonyms
are necessary.
Richard the First bursts in the house and slams the door.
GILFOYLE
How was your day at school, honey?
7.
RICHARD
Raviga is forcing me to interview
my own replacement.
ERLICH
Finally!
Erlich runs out.
GILFOYLE
(to Richard)
Wow. And you actually said yes.
Hey, go like this.
Gilfoyle opens his mouth and says "Ahhh," as if at a
physical. Richard is confused but follows doctor's orders.
GILFOYLE
Yeah, you'll make a decent
fluffer.
Erlich returns with a... Hello Kitty diary.
ERLICH
When I was building Aviato, I
wanted to hire the brightest minds
of our generation. So I tried to
come up with some of those
interview brainteasers like the
big guys use.
RICHARD
And?
ERLICH
And I got high.
GILFOYLE
Why are they in a Hello Kitty
diary.
ERLICH
Asked and answered.
RICHARD
Okay, I'll try them out. It's not
like I want to hire these people
anyway.
ERLICH
And make sure Raviga keeps the
interviews on the DL.
